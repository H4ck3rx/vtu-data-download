download data from vtu for now only downloads data of 4pa12cs trying to improve it for other batch
it works only in linux os.if you have any version of linux just download my file named hack.sh
then open the terminal goto the path were the file is then type sh hack.sh
it will ask for the limit give the limit greater than 0.and check the folder where hack.sh is present you will find a file 
named result.csv.which is the output.for any suggestions please be free..
